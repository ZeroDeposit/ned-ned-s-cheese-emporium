# Ned Ned's Cheese Emporium

You are the developer of an online artisan cheese shop called Ned Ned's Cheese Emporium. Your customers are UK based and pay you £19.99 per order.

You buy your cheese from France in euros, in order to make a profit you must charge at least 3.24€ per block of cheese sold.

Create a website which shows how many blocks of cheese your customers will get for their £19.99.

For example if 1 pound was worth 2 euros then our customers would get 12 pieces of cheese for their £19.99 and the website would look like `index.html`.

Tips:
- You can use any webframework or language you like
- Use the https://openexchangerates.org/ API to get the pound to euro exchange rate in realtime, use the free version https://openexchangerates.org/signup/free
- Include a README of how to get the project installed
- Use git for version control and put the code on Github
- Write tests in the ways you normally would when building a web app
